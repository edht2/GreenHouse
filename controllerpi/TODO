Hello Daddy or Sam or whoever reads this:

Please write notes and add todo items!
It is a good idea to read over these just so you understand the greenhouse better

NOTES:
    If you can't ssh into a sensorpi, unplug it and plug it back in

    Both of the acctuator and solenoid classes have been made usless for testing purposes! To arm them again, uncomment the "relay.turn_on_relay..."

    All log messages are sent to the MQTT topic "log"
    All messages related in any way to a climate zone will have the prefix "climate_zone_<number>/foo/bar1"

    Don't add todo items unless we have discussed it is a good idea

TODO:
    → Correct the relay indexes for the acctuators and solenoids in "app/config/state.json"

    ✅  → Water the beds based on soil moisture

    → Add temperature, humidity and co₂ managment

    → Allow communmication between the controllerpi and the flask app 

    ✅  → Add a safe mode for beds when the soil moisture sensor status returns "ER"
        This could work in 3 ways as we discussed (ordered in practicality: low-high):

         · Water it for a few minutes in the morning and evening

         · Time what it usually takes in ticks between watering then wait the same amount of time
           after watering. You could also time the normal time it takes to water

         · Water it based on the ajacent bed

         · Water based on a set timer
    
    ✅  → Restarting greenhouse at midnight, this includes sensorpis

    → Calibrate the chirp sensors


With all of these features added effectivly we will have a pretty good greenhouse 😎 😎
