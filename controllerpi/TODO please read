Hello Daddy or Sam or whoever reads this:

Please write notes and add todo items!
It is a good idea to read over these just so you understand the greenhouse better

NOTES:
    If you can't ssh into a sensorpi, unplug it and plug it back in

    Both of the acctuator and solenoid classes have been made usless! To arm them again, uncomment the "relay.turn_of_relay..."

    All log messages are sent to the MQTT topic "log"
    All messages related in any way to a climate zone will have the prefix "climate_zone_<number>/foo/bar1"

    Ask Ed if you are not sure
    Don't add todo items unless we have discussed it is a good idea

TODO:
    â†’ Correct the relay indexes for the acctuators and solenoids in "app/config/state.json"

    â†’ Water the beds based on soil moisture

    â†’ Add temerature, humidity and co2  managment

    â†’ Allow communmication between the controllerpi and the flask app 

    â†’ Add a safe mode for beds when the soil moisture sensor status returns "ER"
        This could work in 3 ways as we discussed (ordered in practicality):

         Â· Water it for a few minutes in the morning and evening

         Â· Time what it usually takes in ticks between watering then wait the same amount of time
           after watering. You could also time the normal time it takes to water

         Â· Water it based on the ajacent bed
    
    â†’ Restarting greenhouse at midnight, this includes sensorpis


With all of these features added effectivly we will have a pretty good greenhouse ðŸ˜Ž ðŸ˜Ž
